# PapyCrypt
crypt-decrypt program in base-78.

I used some of the characters in the ASCII table and rearranged them from 1 to 78. Then I used this new 78-based table to crypt and decrypt messages.
PapyCrypt.pyw and PapyCrypt.exe are the final programs (for now). The main.py can be used for debugging.
